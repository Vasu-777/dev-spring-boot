# Spring Boot Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Spring Boot application demonstrating key aspects of enterprise Java development. It covers various features including Spring Core, Hibernate, JPA, REST APIs, Spring MVC, and security integration. Each module illustrates a different facet of Spring Boot development, with practical implementations of CRUD operations, advanced JPA mappings, and more.

## Key Features:

1. **Spring Boot Overview**  
   Introduction to Spring Boot and its core features to develop production-ready applications.

2. **Spring Core**  
   Utilization of Spring Core components like Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC).

3. **Hibernate and JPA CRUD Operations**  
   Implementation of CRUD operations using Hibernate ORM and JPA for seamless data handling.

4. **REST CRUD with Spring Boot**  
   Building RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations, providing a clean and modular architecture.

5. **Security in REST APIs**  
   Implementing security mechanisms such as JWT authentication and authorization for REST APIs.

6. **Spring MVC Integration**  
   Integrating Spring MVC to handle web-based requests and responses, including form handling.

7. **Spring MVC CRUD Operations**  
   Handling CRUD operations in a web-based MVC architecture.

8. **Spring MVC Security**  
   Securing MVC applications using Spring Security, including role-based access control.

9. **Advanced JPA Mappings**  
   Demonstrating advanced JPA mappings like One-to-Many, Many-to-Many relationships, and embedded objects.

10. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**  
   Implementing cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management using Spring AOP.
